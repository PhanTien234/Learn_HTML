    <!--There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
    1. Absolute URL: Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
    Ex: src="https://www.example.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
    Note: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.
    2. Relative URL: Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. 
    Ex: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. 
    Ex: src="/images/img_girl.jpg". 
    Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

<!--An HTML element is everything from start tag to the end tag
    <tagname> Content goes here</tagname>

    But, Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element have the enter function). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
    Note: HTML is Not Case Sensitive, that means HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>
-->
<!--HTML Attributes
    All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attribute provide additional information about elements
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag
